"Chess is played on a square chessboard, consisting of 64 squares of "

"player controls the white pieces and the other player controls the black "
"pieces; the player that controls white is the first to move. The players "

"the next move. Theoreticians have developed extensive chess strategies and "
"tactics since the game's inception."
