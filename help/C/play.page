  <title>How to play</title>

  <p>The player who controls the white pieces is the first to move. Click on
  the piece that you plan to move. If <link xref="change-look-feel"><gui>Move
  hints</gui></link> has been enabled, the possible fields onto which the piece
  can be moved will display the chosen piece in a transparent way. Click on the
  field onto which you want to move the piece. Afterwards, it is the turn of
  the <link xref="chess-engines">opponent</link>.</p>

  <p>Starting GNOME Chess displays the main game window as shown below.</p>
