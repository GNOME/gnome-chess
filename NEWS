3.9.5 - July 29, 2013
=====================

Note for distributors:

We now recommend installing the HoiChess engine by default, instead of GNUChess
or Phalanx (or really anything else), in order to make the game actually
winnable for mortals.  See the long-running Bug #475535 for more information on
why HoiChess is recommended.  The Debian package has build patches, if needed.

- Don't start new game if new game dialog is deleted
- 3D: bottom-right corner should be white
- Preferences: move "opposing player" to the top
- Side and difficulty selection should be insensitive in human vs. human games
- Update About dialog copyright notice
- Fix board numbering when Black is on bottom
- Some new toolbar items were missing tooltips
- Add keyboard shortcuts for previous/next move
- 3D: improve alignment of file letters
- Autosave: always forget games after they are completed
- Remove face-to-face board orientation
- Suggest longer game durations
- Instruct CECP engines to add randomness to play
